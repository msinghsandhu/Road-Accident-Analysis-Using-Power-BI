# Road-Accident-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

## Problem Statement:
The road accident dataset offers valuable insights into the occurrence, characteristics, and contributing factors of traffic accidents. However, several challenges persist in understanding and mitigating road safety issues. One significant problem to address is the identification of key factors influencing the frequency and severity of accidents, including road conditions, weather, driver behavior, vehicle types, and infrastructure. Additionally, there is a need to develop predictive models to anticipate accident hotspots and patterns, enabling proactive measures to prevent accidents and reduce their impact on road users.

## Solution Approach:

To address the problem statement, the following approach was used:

### * Data Import: 
  The dataset was provided by Kaggle in CSV format.

### * Data Modeling and Relationship Creation: 
   Data modeling was performed within Power BI to create relationships between the relevant tables in the dataset. This step ensured that the data could be properly analyzed and visualized.

### * Data Cleaning and Transformation: 
Power BI's data transformation features, such as Power Query, were utilized to clean and transform the data. Irrelevant entries, duplicates, and inconsistencies were removed or resolved, ensuring the data was accurate and reliable.

### * Dashboard Creation - Key Insights: 

The first type of dashboard, "Key Insights," was created to provide an overview of the bike sharing trend along with following KPI's:

    * Primary KPI's - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY Growth
    * Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY Growth
    * Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to Vehicle Type for Current Year
    * Monthly Trend showing comparison of Casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
    * Casualties by Road Type for Current Year
    * Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & Day/Night
    * Total Casualties and Total Accident by Location


The dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific dimensions or time periods of interest.

## Expected Outcome:
By implementing the above solution approach, we expect to achieve the following outcomes:

   * Enhanced Data Analysis: Utilizing Power BI facilitates real-time or near-real-time analysis of road accidents, enhancing the efficiency of data exploration and interpretation. This advanced analytics solution empowers users to delve deeper into the dataset, enabling more thorough insights and comprehension.

   * Improved Decision Making: The implementation of the Key Insights dashboard provides users with a holistic perspective of accidents, fostering informed decision-making processes. By discerning patterns across various dimensions, such as condition of road and customer behaviors, government can optimize operational strategies, refine maintenance schedules, and target specific seasons for frequent road maintainance.

   * Increased Efficiency: Leveraging Power BI's robust data transformation capabilities streamlines tasks related to data cleaning and manipulation. This efficiency gain allows users to dedicate more time to analyzing data and extracting actionable insights, ultimately enhancing productivity and effectiveness in decision-making processes.

  
     
This solution approach harnesses the capabilities of Power BI to deliver a comprehensive data analysis and visualization solution, helping government to make rules on each type of vehicle to reduce the accidents.
